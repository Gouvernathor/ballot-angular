However, 1/3 of voters LOVE Triangle and HATE Square. Under FPTP, IRV & Condorcet, Square wins, coz a majority of voters barely prefer him. But under Approval & Score, Triangle wins, coz she's intensely loved by her minority. Now, is this OKAY? Is this a betrayal of democracy, or actually *saving* democracy from a tyranny of the majority? This question's not just theoretical, it's *philosophical*.`,

Very polarized voters. Under FPTP & IRV, Hexagon doesn't stand a chance. But even though he's few voters' #1 pick, he's a LOT of voters' #2 pick, so under Approval & Score, he wins in a landslide! Is that bad? That a good, fair compromise can prevail in such a polarized world? I think not! Why? Coz Hexagon's also actually a Condorcet winner! TAKE THAT, APPROVAL HATERS`,

        If you'd like your own model included here,
        save it, copy the saved link, and tweet it while <a href="https://twitter.com/ncasenmare">mentioning me, @ncasenmare!</a>
        And then!... maaaaaybe I'll see it and include it in the list.
        I dunno, I'm really bad at checking my Twitter, which,
        honestly, is probably for the best.
