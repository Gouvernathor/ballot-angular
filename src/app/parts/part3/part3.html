        <s>DEAR JUSTIN “TOTES ADORBZ” TRUDEAU</s></strong>
        <br>
        <b style="font-size:0.8em">(UPDATE: okay, dear everyone <i>else</i> around the world pushing for voting reform)</b>
    </p>

    <p>Thank you for taking this small but powerful first step! We've known for way too long that our current voting system – First Past The Post – forces voters to be dishonest, creates a polarizing &quot;lesser of two evils&quot; scenario, and screws over both major <em>and</em> minor candidates.</p>

    <p>
    However, you're probably only considering Instant Runoff Voting.
    Which, to be fair, <em>is</em> better than than First Past The Post,
    and if it's a choice between just those two, <em>definitely</em> go for Instant Runoff.
    But IRV still has a glitch as undemocratic as FPTP's –
    and worse, in our age of distrust, Instant Runoff's lack of transparency may be deadly for democracy.
    Yes, sure, IRV was the best voting system we could come up with...
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_and_use_of_instant-runoff_voting">in 1870</a>.
    And since then, IRV has dominated the conversation,
    unwittingly framing the whole voting reform debate as “simple vs expressive”.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>But that is a false choice.</b> Thanks to computer simulations, real-life studies, and a bunch of math nerds,
    <b>we now know of voting systems that are both simple <i>and</i> expressive.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
    <i>Personally</i>, I'm leaning towards Score Voting.
    It's simple, very expressive, and already familiar to anyone who's seen Amazon's or Yelp's “five star” review system.
    But that's just my humble opinion.
    You could also make the case that Approval Voting is more <i>practical</i>,
    because it's even simpler, and would <i>already work with existing voting machines!</i>
    All you'd need to do is change the instructions from
    “vote for the candidate you like” to “vote for the candidate<b class="underline">s</b> you like”.
    </p>

    <p>
    <em>Or maybe I'm completely wrong about Instant Runoff Voting, and it's actually pretty okay.</em>
    Heck, you could even go for Borda Count, as a hilarious prank.
    </p>

    <p>I won't claim to know which voting system is The Best&trade;. I shall keep open this discussion, just as long as we <em>have</em> this discussion. For three reasons:</p>

    <p>1) If I claim one voting system is the best, end of story, all the social-choice-theory nerds will be on my butt, yelling, BUT NICKY WHAT ABOUT <a href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/research/eric-posner-quadratic-vote-buying-efficient-corporate-governance/qanda">QUADRATIC VOTE BUYING</a></p>

    <p>2) We still need to test these alternative voting systems with <em>actual experience</em>,
    not just <span style="text-decoration:line-through">annoying internet flame wars between IRV advocates and Score Voting advocates</span> theory.
    All the more reason for small towns, local states, and nations like Canada to be <em>pioneers</em>, to bravely experiment!</p>

    <p>3) Keeping the discussion going is what democracy <em>is</em>.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.journalofdemocracy.org/article/danger-deconsolidation-democratic-disconnect">A recent study</a> found that in many Western countries – from Sweden to Australia to the United States – support for democracy has <em>plummeted</em> over the last several generations.
    In 2011, almost <em>a full quarter</em> of young Americans said democracy was a &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;very bad&quot; way to run a country.
    And <em>today</em>, one in six Americans say it'd be &quot;good&quot; or &quot;very good&quot; to be under <em>actual military rule</em>.
    </p>

    <p>Our age of distrust goes a <em>lot</em> deeper than the technical details of a voting system. There isn't gonna be One Weird Trick to fix democracy. But as a first step, a low-hanging fruit, a way to show that, <em>yes</em>, you will make the system respond to the needs and wants and pains and hopes and dreams of your people – well, fixing our voting system's a good start as any.</p>

    <p>Because, this isn't just about trying to build a better ballot.</p>

    <p>This is about trying to build a better <em>democracy</em>.</p>

    <p><strong>P.S:</strong> Since you've read &amp; played this all the way, here, have a bonus!
    A “Sandbox Mode” of the election simulator, with up to <em>five</em> candidates.
    You can also save &amp; share your very own custom election scenario with others. Happy simulating!</p>
