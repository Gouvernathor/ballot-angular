            <p>
            <b>For citizens:</b> Remember, <i>think global, but act local</i>.
            Change from the bottom-up lasts longer.
            If you're in the US,
            <a href="http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/">find your representative</a>
            and badger 'em.
            If you're in Canada,
            <a href="http://www.lop.parl.gc.ca/ParlInfo/compilations/houseofcommons/memberbypostalcode.aspx">find your Member of Parliament</a>
            and badger 'em.
            Also if you're Canadian,
            <a href="https://www.mydemocracy.ca/">fill out the MyDemocracy.ca survey before the end of 2016!</a>
            This survey has a few questions specifically about voting reform!
            (sadly, the question is <i>still</i> framed as "simple vs expressive".
            <i>that</i> is why i've been so gung-ho about Approval &amp; Score,
            and maybe a bit too mean towards IRV)
            </p>

            <p>
            <b>For learners:</b>
            Watch CGP Grey's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7679C7ACE93A5638"><i>Politics in the Animal Kingdom</i></a> series!
            It's charming, and covers more ground than I did here – it explains
            gerrymandering, proportional representation, and more.
            Also, read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gaming-Vote-Elections-Arent-About/dp/0809048922"><i>Gaming The Vote</i></a> by
            William Poundstone.
            It's a thrilling read,
            with dramatic human stories of crooks &amp; conmen trying to game our glitchy voting systems –
            and sometimes, succeeding.

            <p>
            This "explorable explanation" was directly inspired by these two projects:
            </p>
            <img src="img/zesty.png" style="width:100%"/>
            <p>
            <a href="http://zesty.ca/voting/sim/">Voting Sim Visualization</a> by Ka-Ping Yee (2005)
            was a real eye-opener.
            (hat tip to <a href="https://twitter.com/worrydream/status/781324328054951936">Bret Victor</a> for sharing it with me!)
            I've heard lots of written debate over FPTP vs IRV vs Condorcet vs Approval vs blah blah blah,
            but I'd never seen their difference <i>visualized</i> so clearly!
            It gave me instant insight.
            And it actually changed my mind – I used to think IRV was pretty good,
            but after seeing IRV's <i>messiness</i> (as shown above), I realized it's actually kinda stinky cheese.
            </p>
            <p>
            However, even <i>this</i> brilliant visualization was still too abstract.
            And since it wasn't interactive, I couldn't test the many questions &amp; scenarios that came to mind.
            So that's why my second inspiration was...

            <p>
            <a href="http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/">Up and Down the Ladder of Abstraction</a>
            by Bret Victor (2011).
            It's one of the web's earliest "explorable explanations" (also a term Bret coined)
            and it is <i>gorgeous</i>.
            Obviously, I borrowed the format of mixing words &amp; "games" to explain things,
            but I also followed the formula of starting concrete – one voter –
            then moving up to the more abstract – a whole election.

            who spent way too much time thinking about all this.

            Every once in a while, I'll fall into an endless rabbithole –
            like this one on voting systems – and slowly crawl my way out, bloodied and bruised,
            with a new interactive thing for you!
