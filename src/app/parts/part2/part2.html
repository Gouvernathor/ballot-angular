HOW DO THE ALTERNATIVES HOLD UP?

<div class="words" id="how-are-the-alternatives">
    <p>Remember that simulation of the spoiler effect from earlier? Well, here it is again, but now you can switch between the six different voting systems! Here's the &quot;spoiler effect&quot; simulation again. See how different voting systems deal with potential spoilers:</p>
</div>
<div class="sim-test">
    <p class="caption-test">
    drag <img src="hexagon.svg"> to <em>just under</em> <img src="triangle.svg"> to create a spoiler effect.<br>
    then compare the 6 different voting systems:
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:0.8em">
    (note: in the rare cases there's a tie, i just randomly pick a winner)
    </span>
    </p>

    <app-election-model id="election1"
        defaultElectionMethod="FPTP"
        [defaultCandidates]="[[50, 125], [250, 125], [280, 280]]"
        [defaultVoterGroups]="[[155, 125]]"
    />
</div>
<div class="words">

    <p>As you could see, <em>every</em> voting system except First Past The Post is immune to the spoiler effect. So, that's it, right? Ding dong, the glitch is dead? Just pick any other alternative voting system and be done with it?</p>

    <p>But, alas. In getting rid of one glitch, some of these alternative voting systems create <em>other</em> glitches – for some, the cure is even worse than the disease.</p>

    <p>For example, here's a sim of Instant Runoff Voting. In the beginning, Tracy Triangle <img src="triangle.svg"/> is already winning, and you're going to move the voters even <em>closer</em> to her. Obviously, if a candidate is already winning an election, and becomes even <em>more</em> popular, they should <em>still</em> win afterwards, right?</p>

    <p>You can probably guess where this is going...</p>
</div>
<div class="sim-test" id="drag-voters-towards">

    <p class="caption-test">
    drag the voters <img src="voters.svg"> <em>slowly</em> up towards <img src="triangle.svg">:
    </p>

    <app-election-model id="election2"
        [features]="1"
        defaultElectionMethod="IRV"
        [defaultCandidates]="[[41, 271], [257, 27], [159, 65]]"
        [defaultVoterGroups]="[[257, 240]]"
    />

</div>
<div class="words">

    <p>What happened?
    Originally, <img src="hexagon.svg"/> is eliminated in the first round, so
    <img src="triangle.svg"/>
    goes against a weaker <img src="square.svg"/>, and wins.
    But when you move the voters closer to <img src="triangle.svg"/>,
    the loser <em>changes!</em>
    So now, <img src="square.svg"/> is eliminated in the first round,
    which means <img src="triangle.svg"/> goes against a stronger <img src="hexagon.svg"/>,
    and <em>loses</em>.</p>

    <p>Under Instant Runoff, it's possible for a winning candidate to lose, <em>by becoming more popular</em>. What a glitch!</p>

    <p>How often does this actually happen in real life? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonicity_criterion#Real-life_monotonicity_violations">There's a couple confirmed examples</a>, and <a href="http://www.rangevoting.org/Monotone.html">mathematicians estimate this glitch would happen about 14.5% of the time</a>. But sadly, we can't know for sure, because governments usually <em>don't release enough info about the ballots</em> to reconstruct an IRV election &amp; double-check the results.</p>

    <p>So, not only is Instant Runoff's glitch as undemocratic as First Past The Post's glitch, it's possibly <em>worse</em> – because while FPTP's counting method is simple and transparent, Instant Runoff is anything but. And a lack of transparency is an even deadlier sin nowadays, when our trust in government is already so low.</p>

    <p>(But wait! We'll be talking about the risk of <em>strategic voting</em> later.
    Can IRV make a comeback? Stay tuned...)</p>

    <p>So much for the most popular alternative. What about the second-most popular, Borda Count? In this next simulation, you move a losing candidate closer to <em>another</em> losing candidate. Under FPTP, the spoiler effect would split their votes, making both of them lose even more. But watch what happens under Borda Count instead...</p>

</div>
<div class="sim-test" id="borda-count-spoiler">

    <p class="caption-test">
    drag <img src="hexagon.svg"> to <em>just slightly left</em> of <img src="square.svg">:
    </p>

    <app-election-model id="election3"
        [features]="1"
        defaultElectionMethod="Borda"
        [defaultCandidates]="[[173, 150], [275, 150], [23, 150]]"
        [defaultVoterGroups]="[[232, 150]]"
    />

</div>
<div class="words">

    <p>Yup. Borda Count has a <em>reverse</em> spoiler effect. Instead of one good candidate hurting another good candidate by moving closer, with Borda Count, one bad candidate can <em>help</em> another bad candidate by moving closer.</p>

    <p>Here's what happened: at first, some voters ranked
    <img src="square.svg"/>&gt;<img src="triangle.svg"/>&gt;<img src="hexagon.svg"/>,
    but when you moved <img src="hexagon.svg"/> closer to <img src="square.svg"/>,
    those voters then <em>swung</em> to ranking
    <img src="square.svg"/>&gt;<img src="hexagon.svg"/>&gt;<img src="triangle.svg"/>,
    hurting <img src="triangle.svg"/> enough
    to make her lose to <img src="square.svg"/>.</p>

    <p>Still, Borda's not the worst, and at least it's simpler and more transparent than Instant Runoff. But how does Condorcet Method compare? When Condorcet picks a winner, it's always the “theoretically best” winner – but that's <em>when</em> it picks a winner.</p>

    <p>So far, I've just been simulating voters as a <em>single</em> group, with a center and some spread. But seeing how polarized politics is nowadays, one could imagine <em>several</em> groups of voters, with totally different centers. Now, Condorcet tries to pick the candidate who beats all other candidates in one-on-one races. But with <em>polarized</em> voters, you could end up with a Rock-Paper-Scissors-like loop, where a majority of voters prefer A to B, B to C, <em>and</em> C to A.</p>

    <p>In certain situations, the other voting systems just had glitches. In Condorcet, the voting system <em>crashes.</em> Try it out for yourself:</p>
</div>
<div class="sim-test" id="create-condorcet-cycle">

    <p class="caption-test">
    create your own “condorcet cycle”!<br>
    move the voters <img src="voters.svg"> in such a way that NOBODY wins:
    </p>

    <app-election-model id="election4"
        [features]="2"
        defaultElectionMethod="Condorcet"
        [defaultCandidates]="3"
        [defaultVoterGroups]="3"
    />

</div>
<div class="words">

    <p>Now, in actual practice – not that any government actually uses this voting system – when Condorcet fails to find a winner, the election falls back to another method like Borda Count. But if you do that, it'll get the glitches of its backup method. So it goes.</p>

    <p>First Past The Post. Instant Runoff. Borda Count. Condorcet Method. Those were all the voting systems that use <em>ranking</em> – the ones that our math boy, Kenneth Arrow, proved would <em>always</em> be unfair or glitchy in some big way. What about the voting systems that <em>don't</em> use ranking, like Approval &amp; Score voting? Well...</p>

    <p>...I couldn't come up with a simulation to show their flaws. Because, <em>in theory</em>, they don't have many big flaws.</p>

    <p>
    But that's a really, really, really big <em>“in theory!”</em>
    It may be that, in <em>practice</em>, strategic voters use Approval &amp; Score Voting exactly like First Past The Post –
    only approving or giving 5 stars to their top candidate, and disapproving or giving 1 star to all others,
    even if they actually <em>like</em> the others.
    <a href="http://archive3.fairvote.org/research-and-analysis/blog/why-approval-voting-is-unworkable-in-contested-elections/">(See FairVote's critique of Approval Voting, and defense of Instant Runoff)</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    Then again, even if Approval &amp; Score Voting disincentivize you from expressing an honest <em>second</em> choice,
    FPTP and IRV punish you for expressing an honest <em>first</em> choice.
    Besides, if Approval can be "gamed", then that goes double for IRV.
    <a href="http://www.rangevoting.org/LNH.html">(See this mathematician's critique of FairVote's critique, and defense of Approval)</a>
    So, in the end... [confused shrugging sounds]</p>

    <p>
    We're gonna need a hecka lot more simulations.
    </p>

    <p>
    So, below is a chart
    <a href="https://electology.org/tactical-voting-basics">(source)</a>,
    showing the results of 2.2 <em>million</em> simulations.
    A <i>huge</i> variety of scenarios were tested. All-honest voters.
    All-strategic voters. Half-honest, half-strategic.
    Voters who know each others' preferences.
    Voters who <i>don't</i> know each others' preferences.
    Voters who only sorta-know each others' preferences.
    And so on.
    You can tell that a <em>real</em> mathematician made this chart,
    because it's makin' my eyes bleed:
    </p>

    <p><img class="real" src="comparison.png"></p>

    <p>
    Each voting method's results is shown as an ugly-blue bar.
    The further to the right a voting method is, the more it "maximizes happiness" for the voters.
    The higher up a voting method is, the simpler it is.
    And a bar's width shows the range of a voting system's performance,
    given different ratios of honest-to-strategic voters.
    </p>

    <p>
    The first thing to note is that strategic voting makes voters <em>less happy</em> than honest voting
    – in <em>all</em> voting systems! I was very surprised when I first learnt that.
    (But it makes sense, if you think about, say, a crowded room full of people trying to talk. Any one person can be &quot;strategic&quot; by shouting over others, but if <em>everybody</em> is &quot;strategic&quot;, nobody can hear anybody, and all you're left with is sore throats and sad peeps.)</p>

    <p>The other thing to note is which voting systems make people the happiest. If you have mostly honest voters, <em>Score Voting is best</em>. (with Borda Count a close second) And if you have mostly strategic voters, then <em>both Approval &amp; Score Voting are best</em>. (and with strategic voters, IRV does <em>just as bad</em> as FPTP)</p>

    <p>However, those are still computer simulations. How would these different voting systems play out <em>in real life?</em> Well, we can't just get the DeLorean up to 88, go back in time before the 2016 election, change the voting system, and see what would happen...</p>

    <p><em>...or can we?!</em></p>

    <p>No, no we can't. But last month, researchers did something close enough.
    <a href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/25/13733322/instant-runoff-ranked-voting-2016">A polling study asked 1,000+ U.S. registered voters to rank &amp; rate the six presidential candidates</a>,
    to simulate who would've won the (popular) vote under different voting systems!
    (But keep in mind that if we had a different voting system in the primaries, we'd have different candidates <em>entirely</em>.
    So take this study with a pillar of salt.)
    The results: under Instant Runoff, Condorcet, and Approval Voting, the winner would've been Hillary Clinton. But under Score Voting, the winner would've been Donald Trump. And under Borda Count, the winner would've been... uh... <em>Gary Johnson?</em>
    </p>

    <p><em>?????</em></p>

    />

<div class="words">

    <p>Anyway.</p>

    <p>Before we wrap all this up – remember Kenneth Arrow? The infamous mathematician who founded the study of voting systems in the 1950's? Well, <a href="https://electology.org/podcasts/2012-10-06_kenneth_arrow">in an interview 60 years later</a>, Kenneth Arrow had this to say, about which voting method he likes most now:</p>

    <blockquote class="quote">
    <em>“Well, I’m a little inclined to think that score systems</em> [like Approval &amp; Score Voting] <em>where you categorize in maybe three or four classes</em> [so, giving a score out of 3 or 4, not 10 or 100] <em>probably – in spite of what I said about manipulation</em> [strategic voting] <em>– is probably the best.”</em>
    </blockquote>

    <p>That's as strong an endorsement as you'll ever squeeze out of a math-head.</p>
