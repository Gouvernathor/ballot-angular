        One hope for Sandbox Mode is that readers can debate with me and each other <em>using</em> this tool!
        Not just telling me I'm wrong, but <em>showing</em> me I'm wrong.
        For example –
        <a routerLink="/sandbox" [queryParams]="{
            s: 'FPTP',
            v: [[54, 147], [54, 72], [249, 109]],
            c: [[54, 227], [249, 106]],
            d: `This is the biggest challenge to Approval/Score, IMHO. Below: 2/3 of voters dislike both candidates, but dislike Square slightly less. However, 1/3 of voters LOVE Triangle and HATE Square. Under FPTP, IRV & Condorcet, Square wins, coz a majority of voters barely prefer him. But under Approval & Score, Triangle wins, coz she's intensely loved by her minority. Now, is this OKAY? Is this a betrayal of democracy, or actually *saving* democracy from a tyranny of the majority? This question's not just theoretical, it's *philosophical*.`,
        }">
            here's a model I made in Sandbox Mode,
            showing an interesting argument <em>against</em> Approval &amp; Score Voting</a>.
        Granted, this tool is very limited – it doesn't handle strategic voting or imperfect information –
        but I think it's a start, and may help improve our Democratic Discourse&trade;
